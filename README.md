# SeleniumMSTEST

Its PLug and play 
You would need VSTS 2019 to execute the same . Solution is in MSTEST format 
For generating report same has to be done using Command Prompt . Was not able to add any custom Report template . 
- All the Test Scenarios are available under Tests -> "Scenarios.cs" class file
- Have used POM for the framework
- Core folder -> SauceDemo.cs file acts as the Page Factory setup and selenium initialization
- DataLibrary carries data thats used for the test to execute
- CrossBrowser support for the IE and Chrome is updated and same can be extended to Edge and Firefox
- All config data is set up in App.config file
